# Bird Species Detection üê¶

**Bird Species Detection** is a machine learning project designed to classify different species of birds using TensorFlow. It leverages a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to identify bird species based on their images. The project aims to support wildlife research and enthusiasts by providing a reliable and scalable detection system.
